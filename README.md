# Diabetes Analysis
As part of the Ironhack Data Analytics course, my mid-hootcamp project was an attempt to understand the factors that may influence a diabetes diagnosis.

# Motivation
Diabetes is one of the leading chronic disease affecting at least 10% of the global world population. Understanding the factors influencing them may help us to predict to help more people.

# Tech/framework used
- Python Jupyter notebook
- Pandas
- Visualizations using Tableau
  
# Features
- Data cleaned with 24 columns retained that are assumed to be relevant to diabetes.
- A predictive model using Logistic Regression to predict occurence of Diabetes.
  -- Achieved a recall rate of 0.985
- Tableau Visualization of the Data Analysis - [here][https://public.tableau.com/views/DiabetesCDCAnalysis/Health_Diabetes?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link]
